                <h1>10/10 The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (30 Million Units)</h1>
                <p>Following a handful of delays, 2015's Game of the Year released on May 19th, 2015 for PC, Xbox One,
                    and PlayStation 4 with a release on the Nintendo Switch coming in 2019. The Witcher 3 also received
                    two content-packed expansions which were later bundled with the game as a complete edition.</p><br><p>

                    CD Projekt Red's RPG surrounding a silver-haired monster-slaying Witcher, his horse, and a massive
                    collection of Gwent cards had over 1.5 million pre-orders prior to its launch and has since gone on
                    to sell over 30 million copies, thanks in large to its DLC and the Netflix series which premiered in
                    2019.</p>

                <h1>09/10 Diablo 3 (30 Million Units)</h1>
                <p>In 2012, Blizzard Entertainment launched Diablo III. The game arrived more than a decade on from the series' second installment, with console ports following over the next few years. The game even got a Nintendo Switch release in 2018 in the form of the Diablo III: Eternal Collection.</p><br><p>
                    With such a massive gap between titles, anticipation was high, and it showed when the third entry released on May 15th. Diablo III became one of the most pre-ordered PC games on Amazon and has since outsold titles including Grand Theft Auto IV, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with over 30 million copies sold worldwide,</p>

                <h1>08/10 The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (30 Million Units)</h1>
                <p>On 11/11/11, Elder Scrolls fans were finally able to get their hands on the series fifth mainline installment. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim released with expectant Dragonborn across the globe lining up in front of stores for days in advance. The highly anticipated title was the latest open-world adventure crafted by Todd Howard and Bethesda.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Having a series of re-releases and just as many patches as Cyberpunk 2077 and its game-breaking bugs, Skyrim originally released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation. It has since become playable on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch, and sold well over 30 million units across all platforms.

                <h1>07/10 Animal Crossing: New Horizons (32.5 Million Units)</h1>
                <p>Despite falling a little short of Super Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild in terms of critical reception, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has outsold them both when it comes to raw unit sales. At the time of writing, it has shifted more than 32 and a half million copies, which also places it in the 20 best selling video games of all time.</p><br><p>
                    The game is bigger and better than its predecessors in almost every way, giving each player their own island to shape and populate as they please. Sales were likely helped by the fact that the game released right at the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic too, with people all over the world stuck inside for months with very little else to do.</p>

The indie title sold an impressive 200,000 copies within the first week of its release and has now sold more than 35 million copies.</p><br><p>
                    These figures make Terraria one of the 15 best-selling video games of all-time, beating out the likes of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Considering the aforementioned titles had far bigger budgets, this is an incredibly impressive feat.</p>

                    Debuting on the Nintendo Switch in 2017, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an enhanced version of the game, which, like its predecessor, is also the best selling on its console.

With over 300 million downloads worldwide, the game sits in the top 5 best-selling video games of all-time, behind only Wii Sports, Tetris, and two of the decade's other big hitters.</p>

                <h1>02/10 Grand Theft Auto V (145 Million Units)</h1>
                <p>Rockstar Games released the fifth mainline installment in its hugely successful series on September 17th, 2013.

                <h1>01/10 Minecraft (200 Million Units)</h1>
                <p>Mojang released this blocky, randomly-generated sandbox title for the PC back in 2011, before later porting it over to consoles and handheld devices. These days, Minecraft has over 100 million active users building across the world and has accumulated countless awards throughout its lifetime.</p><br><p>
                    With over 200 million copies sold since launching on November 18th, 2011, Minecraft is the highest-selling video game of all time by some margin, comfortably beating out the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, Tetris, Wii Sports, Pac-Man. Given that the game still remains incredibly popular, that number seems likely to rise higher still.</p>
